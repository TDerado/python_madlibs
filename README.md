1. Challenges
  - all challenges, some are more fleshed out then others, but all were attempted in some regard.
2. Choose
  - I started with the more technical challenges then moved to the others since I had the time.
3. Workflow
  - using a merge for every feature helps keep  work modular as instead of working towards multiple features at once, I work to finish a feature to push to the main branch before moving onto the next one.
4. Concepts
  - I feel better about the use of modularity and functions as I tried to keep each following part separate to follow challenge 4 (Function Refactoring) after starting with it and it helped improve my function usage, even if nothing is used twice yet, it looks better and could be update easier.
